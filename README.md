# DS4002-Project-3
# Section 1: Software and Platforms
Our code was written in Python using UVA OpenOnDemand (UVA HPC) in order to run the code faster than if we were to use Google Colab. For add-on packages, sklearn was used to split the data into training and testing sets. Tensorflow was used to run our two models: ResNet50V2 and VGG19. Matplotlib was used to evaluate the models and create visualizations.
# Section 2: Map of Documentation
In our repository, there are folders for the data, scripts, and output. The data is from a github repository on brain MRI image classification and is located in the Data folder.
- In the Data folder:
- In the Scripts folder:
- In the Output folder:
# Section 3: Instructions for Reproducing Our Results
1. Navigate to the Scripts folder of our repository, where you will see multiple Python notebook scripts.
2. Download or copy the code from the __ file. This is the file needed to run the ResNet50V2 model and the VGG19 model.
3. Navigate to the Data folder and download the brain_tumor_dataset.zip folder.
4. Upload these files to UVA OpenOnDemand (https://www.rc.virginia.edu/userinfo/hpc/ood/). Run in Juptyer Notebook and keep all of the defaults listed. Open notebook and paste code from the __ file.
5. Once notebook is up and running and code is pasted, make sure that the filepaths for the dataset are where you have the code stored on your local machine. Run the code by selecting Run -> Run All in the Juptyer Notebook tool bar. This will install all necessary packages, run the models, and evaluate the results.
